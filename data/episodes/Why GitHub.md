### Why [GitHub](https://github.com)?

In this introduction we will mention and use [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
[GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
choose to host your Git repository on another platform.

Course participants are most welcome to use our new 
[Nordic research software repository platform](https://source.coderefinery.org) instead,
for more information see 
[https://coderefinery.org/repository/](https://coderefinery.org/repository/).
