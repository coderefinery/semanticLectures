# Introduction to version control with Git

This is the introductory lesson to version control using
[Git](https://git-scm.com/). It is assumed to be the very first thing done in a
course.

Our philosophy is that we start from own local repository, branching and
merging (locally), and a brief introduction to pushing to remotes.  In the
separate [collaborative git lesson](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/), we
teach more use of remote repositories and good collaborative workflows.  We
try to stick to simple workflows, just enough for researchers who aren't
obsessed with git to be able to work well.  We try to avoid commands which
might get you into a confusing state.

Our general flow is 10 minutes on "why version control", followed by
about 45 minutes of the basics of how to make commits.  Then, there are
several small steps until we get to branching, merging, and conflict
resolution. 

Investigating a past commit and going back in time are also introduced.
Great emphasis is made about the importance of not changing history of
shared repositories, when there is a need to undo commits.

Then, we see a little bit about sharing repositories online, how to 
effectively dig into the history of a project,
and a few other random points before we conclude.

The goals of the module as a whole are that the user will feel comfortable
about staging changes, committing them, merging, and branching. The guacamole
example that we use is inspired by [Byron Smith](http://blog.byronjsmith.com),

thread](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss/2016-May/004529.html).
